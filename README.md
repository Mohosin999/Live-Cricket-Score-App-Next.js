## ðŸ“„ Description

I developed a Live Cricket Score Application using Next.js and the Cricbuzz API from RapidAPI. This app provides real-time cricket updates with a clean and responsive UI. It allows users to stay updated with live matches, recent results, upcoming fixtures, and cricket articles.

A scorecard section is also implemented to show detailed match score information. Since the free version of the Cricbuzz API allows only 100 requests per day, I optimized the features to cover the most important sections without overusing API calls.
